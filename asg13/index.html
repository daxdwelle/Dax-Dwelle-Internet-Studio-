  <h1>Assignment 13: Careers</h1>
  <p>I think the ideal job for me would be something in the landscape of digital media. Ever since I’ve been a kid I’ve had a passion for technology and engaging with digital culture. Throughout my time in college pursuing my degree and personal projects I’ve been able to refine my skills as a content creator and build an understanding of algorithms. I think this kind of career path also suits me because I actually get to make things which I find to be a very satisfying experience. Overall, I think my passion for digital and social media on top of the skills I’ve acquired in college make social media coordination or management an ideal career path for me. </p>

  <h2>Social Media Marketing Director</h2>
  <p>This position is asking for someone who is a strong writer which is another field that I have some interest in. They’re asking for someone who’ll be able manage public and b2b social media which is an area I haven’t explored much. One of the key things the hirers are looking for is someone who is always developing which is something I’m also looking for in a career. Organization is a key part of this position as well and organization is something that I’ve mastered through my years in college.  </p>
