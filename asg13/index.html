  <h1>Assignment 13: Careers</h1>
  <p>I think the ideal job for me would be something in the landscape of digital media. Ever since I’ve been a kid I’ve had a passion for technology and engaging with digital culture. Throughout my time in college pursuing my degree and personal projects I’ve been able to refine my skills as a content creator and build an understanding of algorithms. I think this kind of career path also suits me because I actually get to make things which I find to be a very satisfying experience. Overall, I think my passion for digital and social media on top of the skills I’ve acquired in college make social media coordination or management an ideal career path for me. </p>

  <h2>Social Media Marketing Director</h2>
  <p>I think this job would be great for me because I’ve been developing skills that make me a good fit for the role. The description asks for someone who has experience in developing measurable growth and developing content which are both skills that I’ve developed through personal projects. I’ve taken courses that have covered strategy creation and analyzing insights to create more effective content. I’ve also been good at capturing current trends and putting twists on them to create engaging posts.  </p>
