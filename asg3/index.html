	<h2>Framing Project in a Story Format</h2>
	<p>
		Creating user personas that you can build a story around allows you to empathize with the needs of the user. Framing your project in a story format also helps define the scope of a project before you even start making it as you think through peopleâ€™s real life experiences. Furthermore, it helps teams get on the same page when you're framing the design process as a story since it allows separate division to solve the problem of the users instead of worrying about their own domain. Making user experience a story also allows you to put a face on the issue your trying to solve which gives developers a better chance to emotionally connect with the audience. Framing a user experience project as a story also allows the audience to have a say in their experience leading to a more satisfying user experience.
