	<h2>Framing Project in a Story Format</h2>
	<p>
		Creating user personas that you can build a story around allows you to empathize with the needs of the user. Framing your project in a story format also helps define the scope of a project before you even start making it as you think through people’s real life experiences. Furthermore, it helps teams get on the same page when you're framing the design process as a story since it allows separate division to solve the problem of the users instead of worrying about their own domain. Making user experience a story also allows you to put a face on the issue your trying to solve which gives developers a better chance to emotionally connect with the audience. Framing a user experience project as a story also allows the audience to have a say in their experience leading to a more satisfying user experience.

		Size can be used to establish a hierarchy because people’s eyes naturally gravitate to the biggest element on the screen. Color can also be used to establish hierarchy. If all the text on a screen is black, but one piece of text is bright pink then people’s vision will gravitate towards the pink text. Weight is also a factor in establishing text hierarchy. People’s eyes gravitate towards the thickest text on the screen while they look past the thinner text. You can also emphasize certain pieces of text by changing the style.

		The problem is that there isn’t a centralized database that breaks down the techniques and methods used in popular songs. This information exists on the web but there isn’t an easy way to access it. The audience would be musicians, and music fans from 18-25. The competition would be other sites that analyze popular songs in different ways. Some sites are more focused on analyzing lyrics, others break down chord progressions. The key messages would be that this site is educational and practical. You can learn about these techniques and then apply them to your own work. My call to action would motivate people to learn what makes the music they love tick. Success would be measured by visits and how much time people spend on the site.
