	<h1>The Beatles</h1>

<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>
		The Beatles were a 1960s pop band that were formed in Liverpool. The band was made up of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They explored various different sounds like psychedelia, eastern
		music, and hard rock. The band were also notable for their recording innovations, and producing some of the best recieved albums of all time. 
	</p>
<h2>Why they're my favorite</h2>
	<p>
		The Beatles are my favorite band of all time because of their diverse discography, and strong personalitites. The Beatles explored various genres and styles from the straight forward love songs of the early days to the
experimentation of albums like revolver and sgt. pepper's. Even their individual albums can have songs like Octopus's Garden and I Want You (She's So Heavy) back to back. The Beatles are also one of the only bands where every
		member gets the spotlight. John and Paul sang a majority of their most popular songs, but many of the Beatles most iconic songs were sung by George or Ringo. Most bands have an obvious front man who takes up all the 
		lime light while the others fall into the background. Overall, The Beatles are my favorite band because of their exploration of different sounds, and the fact that every member has a strong and likeable personality.
