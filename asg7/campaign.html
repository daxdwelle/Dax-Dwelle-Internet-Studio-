	<h1>Candidate</h1>
	<p>When Terry McGinnis found himself on the grounds of Wayne manor after being chased by Joker thugs. He's assisted by old man Bruce Wayne who decides to take him in as an assistant. After his father is killed
	and he discovers that Bruce Wayne used to be Batman he asks him if he can take up the mantle so he can avenge his father. When Bruce refuses to let Terry take revenge he decides to steal the batsuit and take matters
	into his own hands. After their initial conflict Bruce and Terry decide to work together and Terry becomes the new Batman.</p>
	<p>Terry would make a good president because he's determined and respects history without being unreasonably devoted to it.
	As Batman he proved that he could take an old tradition and adjust it ot fit the needs of a new era. He also has proben that
	he can come up with creative solutions to big problems. An example would be when he decided the best way to defeat the resurrected Joker
	was to make fun of him which is something that had never been tried before. All these elements of Terry's character would make
	him a successful candidate for president.</p>
