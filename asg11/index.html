	<h1>The Dream Team</h1>
	<p>The dream team is the greatest dodgeball team on this side of the universe.
		It’s made of cosmic beings, an obscure NFL wide receiver, and popular 60s musicians. 
		This combination of freak athletes and thought provoking poets strikes fear into the hearts 
		of dodgeball teams around the world. One second they’ll be dodging high powered dodgeballs
		thrown by superman, and the next they’ll be debating the artistic merit of Bob Dylan’s singing voice. 
		If you want to see a dodgeball team that combines power and style then come watch The Dream Team.

	<h2>Spider-Man</h2>
	</div>
	<div class=member-1-bio>
	<p>	Spider-Man is a great fit for this team because he combines with great power and great responsibility. 
		Spider-Man has the proportional strength of a spider which makes him adept at throwing dodgeballs, and 
		he has spider-sense that makes him adept at dodging. He’s also a very unselfish player who’s always willing 
		to help out his fellow team mates. Spider-Man isn’t a leader but he’s a good presence you want in the locker 
		room. His sense of humor also makes him good for team morale.

	<h2>John Lennon</h2>

	<div class=member-2-bio>
	<p>	John Lennon is a great fit for this team because of his experience 
		as a group member and his innovative mindset. As a member of the Beatles 
		John has learned a lot about team chemistry which is experience that can be 
		applied to this team. His innovative work as a musician makes him suited for
		coming up with new and inventive dodgeball strategies. Lennon’s a good locker room 
		presence because of his wit and humor. John brings a very unique approach to sports 
		that’ll make him a key asset for the dream team. </p>
