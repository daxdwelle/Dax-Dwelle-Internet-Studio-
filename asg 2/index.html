    <p>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML? Structured content  is how content on a page is 
        organized with a focus on creating clear relationships between different content chunks. Online recipes, profiles, and
        articles are an example of how structured content is used. Semantic html is the information in code that dictates what
        the relationships are between document elements. Examples of semantic html include heading and list tags. The main 
        difference between the two is semantic html is used to help algorithms guide people to the information they want to 
        see, while structured content is used to guide the eyes of regular people to the information they want to see. </p>
    
       <p> How do they work together? Semantic html and structured content work to organize information and create a satisfying 
        visual presentation. Semantic html’s tags provide structural information to algorithms, while structured content gives
           effective visual guidance to real life people. Structured content on its own can help out algorithms but sometimes
           semantic html needs to be used to give the algorithm hints. Html structure also assists with visual presentation 
           as people know what headers and lists mean. Overall, in order to create a satisfying and convenient experience for
           users web designers need to use semantic html and structured content.</p> 
    
     <p>   Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages? It’s important to have semantic 
        html, and structured content so that your site can be easily found through multiple means. Semantic HTML and 
        structured content allow people to understand the information on a site, while making it easier for algorithms to 
        find the information that people are searching for. A site with a strong visual presentation may struggle to be 
        found due to its lackluster semantic html. On the other hand information that’s well organized for an algorithm may 
        not be well organized for a real person.  </p>

    <h2>Required Reading Questions</h2>
    <p>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, 
        which would be most successful for you? Why? The method Denise Jacobs points out that would be the most successful for
        me is seeking the truth. When my inner critic is giving me problems I often think about how realistic the things he’s
        saying are and 90% of the time they make no sense. I think people often fall into the trap of thinking that negative
        thoughts are more valid than positive thoughts, but that is just not the case. Thinking that everything you do is 
        terrible is just as ridiculous as thinking that everything you do is amazing, but one thought feels more valid than 
        the other because it’s negative.

    <p>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract 
        hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you? Hyperbolic discounting is the idea that people prefer the more
        immediate reward and not the better award that will come later. One method that McRaney points out in his article that
        resonated with me was the idea of not trusting your future self. I think this idea works for me because I think about
        a piece of advice I heard a while ago that goes, “if you can do it today then do it today”. If I’m thinking about 
        putting something off I think about how I’m just making things harder on my future self, and all of the unseen 
        circumstances that could come up in a week from now. </p>
    <p>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-
        making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work? One of the four types of power in 
        networks that I do have control over as I learn web publishing fundamentals is what is included and who is included. I
        can control what is included in my work and no one else can change my work without my permission. I can control who 
        sees my work to an extent. If I were to send a link to my work to someone they could theoretically send it to whoever 
        they want and there wouldn’t be anything I could do about it. All in all I have very strong control over what is 
    included and who is included as I publish my work.</p>
