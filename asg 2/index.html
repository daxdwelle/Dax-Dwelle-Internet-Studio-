    <p>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML? Structured content  is how content on a page is 
        organized with a focus on creating clear relationships between different content chunks. Online recipes, profiles, and
        articles are an example of how structured content is used. Semantic html is the information in code that dictates what
        the relationships are between document elements. Examples of semantic html include heading and list tags. The main 
        difference between the two is semantic html is used to help algorithms guide people to the information they want to 
        see, while structured content is used to guide the eyes of regular people to the information they want to see. 
        How do they work together? Semantic html and structured content work to organize information and create a satisfying 
        visual presentation. Semantic html’s tags provide structural information to algorithms, while structured content gives effective visual guidance to real life people. Structured content on its own can help out algorithms but sometimes semantic html needs to be used to give the algorithm hints. Html structure also assists with visual presentation as people know what headers and lists mean. Overall, in order to create a satisfying and convenient experience for users web designers need to use semantic html and structured content.
        Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages? It’s important to have semantic 
        html, and structured content so that your site can be easily found through multiple means. Semantic HTML and 
        structured content allow people to understand the information on a site, while making it easier for algorithms to 
        find the information that people are searching for. A site with a strong visual presentation may struggle to be 
        found due to its lackluster semantic html. On the other hand information that’s well organized for an algorithm may 
        not be well organized for a real person.  </p>
