	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>Here are three things I learned from the assigned readings. The internet started out with mostly static information 
		that people couldn't interact with until the internet's 2nd stage of evolution where user interaction became very 
		prevalent. This was when streaming services, social media, and web content voting started to become the norm. Another 
		thing I learned was that standards of design for websites didn't come naturally; they were actively pushed for by 
		organizations like the W3C.  This led to the development of more diverse styles and layouts as opposed to the 
		uniformity of web design in the days of the early internet. Finally, I learned that in recent years people have 
		become more interested in having personal ownership over their internet presence whether that be through personal 
		websites or a decentralized blockchain.</p>
	<h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
	<p>I would like to make a website that showcases the equipment and instruments that are used on popular songs and albums. 
		Iâ€™d want someone to be able to look up a song and see what kind of guitar is being played, what kind of drum set is
		being used and other production details. This site would serve as an educational source for people who want to learn 
		more about their favorite songs. It would also serve as a reference source for professional musicians who want to find
		out how iconic sounds were created. Much of this information already exists so this site can be used to centralize 
		that information to make it more easily accessible to the general public.
