	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>Future assignments will be listed here</p>
    <p>Here are three things I learned from the assigned readings. The internet started out with mostly static information that 
	   people couldn't interact with until the internet's 2nd stage of evolution where user interaction became very prevalent. 
	   Standards of design for websites didn't come naturallly they were actively pushed for by organizations like the W3C.
	   In recent years people have become more interested in having personal overship over their internet presence whether that be 
	   through personal websites or decentralized blockchain.</p>
	<h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
	<p>I would like to make a website that showcases different kinds of equipment and instruments that are used on popular 
		songs and albums. Iâ€™d want someone to be able to look up a song and see what kind of guitar is being played, 
		what kind of drum set is being used and other production details. I think this kind of site would serve to inform the 
		average person on the technical aspects of music creation. Much of this information already exists so this site can be
		used to centralize that information to make it more easily accessible. </p>
