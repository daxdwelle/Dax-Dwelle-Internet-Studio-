	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>Future assignments will be listed here</p>
    <p>Here are three things I learned from the assigned readings. The internet started out with mostly static information that 
	   people couldn't interact with until the internet's 2nd stage of evolution where user interaction became very prevalent. 
	   Standards of design for websites didn't come naturallly they were actively pushed for by organizations like the W3C.
	   In recent years people have become more interested in having personal overship over their internet presence whether that be 
	   through personal websites or decentralized blockchain.</p>
