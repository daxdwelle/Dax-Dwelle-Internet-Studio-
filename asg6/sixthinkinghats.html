	<h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>
	<h2>White</h2>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>There is a wide range of information on the creation of certain popular songs. 
		This information can be accessed through books, interviews, and studio notes. We need to be able to get 
		information from artists, choose the songs and artists to start our database with, and find reliable sources. 
		The site should provide the lyrics of songs and a way to be able to play the music through the site. 
		We need to think about what legal considerations there are and if we should broaden what subjects the site will cover. 
</p>
	<h2>Red</h2>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p> We feel like this is an idea worth getting excited about. It has utility for musicians who want to learn how to create 
		their favorite sounds. Music companies might want to use it as a place to advertise their products. 
		It’ll be a database for music fans to learn more about the art that they love. However, we do wonder how widespread 
		of an idea this is and how many people would use it. 
</p>
	<h2>Black</h2>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>There is concern about how we can get the information required for this site to work. 
		The idea requires information that isn’t necessarily widely available and may be difficult to access. 
		There may be some legal concerns when it comes to sharing information and giving credit. 
		We wonder if there is really a large demand for this service and if it solves a real problem.</p>
	<h2>Yellow</h2>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p> This is an idea that contains fun information that can be useful for musicians. It may also be useful for 
		people purchasing certain kinds of instruments to see what songs or artists have used that instrument. 
		We can make this work by talking to musicians and seeing what their needs are. Including an in depth 
		searching and filtering system will be key for making this site work. A search system for this site should allow users to pick genre, 
		sort by instrument, and artist. 
</p>
	<h2>Green</h2>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>Instead of just being a written account of information this site could make interviews with artists a 
		central part of its content. It could also branch out into doing full breakdowns on song writing and music 
		theory instead of just equipment. Talking to musicians and making connections is a way that the lack of 
		information problem could be solved. Talking to legal experts and doing in depth research on proper citing 
		is a way we could alleviate any possible legal issues. </p>
	<h2>Blue</h2>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p> Our main subject is music and the instruments and gear used to make music. We’re thinking about how we 
		can reveal secrets about music, appeal to music lovers, and give people a database where they can do a 
		deep dive on their favorite songs. Our goal is to share information about the music that people love. 
		We will keep our discussions on track by always keeping our mission statement in mind. </p>
