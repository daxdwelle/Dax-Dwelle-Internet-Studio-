	<h3>Paul McCartney</h3>
	<img src="images/paul">
	<p>Paul McCartney was one of the musical geniuses beind the Bealtes and is one of the greatest popular song writers of 
	all time. I'd like to invite him to this dinner because I've been a big admire of his work for many years. Having him
	at this dinner would be a great oppurtunity to pick his brain and get to know a personal hero.</p>
	<h3>Spider-Man</h3>
	<img src="images/spiderman.png">
	<p>Spider-Man has been my favorite super hero for as long as I can remember. I always identified with him because he
	was a nerdy kid with glasses which I also was. I've always been moved by his determination and resiliency in the face of 
	hardship which is why I'd want to invite him to this dinner party.</p>
