	<h1>Assignment 8: Domains</h1>
	<h2>Possible Names</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>musathon</li>
		<li>breakingdownmusic</li>
		<li>songrig</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>As me and my colleague discussed the domain names that I had chosen for this site we discussed various elements of these names. We began by talking about the name musathon. We both thought that it rolled off the tongue well and was easy to remember, but we wondered if the name was too broad and didn’t do enough to communicate what the site does. We then talked about breakingdown music which we liked the descriptiveness of, but we wondered if the title was too long to quickly type in or mention in conversation. We finished by talking about songrig. We thought that songrif was easy to remember while being descriptive, but we thought it didn’t roll off the tongue very well. My colleague decided that musathon was the safest option even though it may be too broad.   </p>
	<p>After careful deliberation I have decided that between the 3 domain names songrig will be the one I’m moving forward with. The main reason I favor songrig is that it’s both descriptive and catchy. I am somewhat bothered by the ugliness of saying the site, but I feel it’s more important for the site name to be descriptive than fancy. My main problem with musathon is that it was too vague, and my main problem with breakingdownmusic is that it was too long. I feel that the name songrig is the best of both world and it’ll be the name that I continue this project with. </p>
