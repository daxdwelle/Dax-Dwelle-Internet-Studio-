<h1>Things to do in Gotham</h1>
	<h2>Find Riddler Trophies</h2>
	<p>Throughout Gotham the villainous Riddler places trophis all over the city for people to fidn. In order to acquire
	these trophies typically you'll have to solve a puzzle or riddle. These trophies aren't necessarily intended for 
	the average citizen, but there's nothing stopping you from engaging with them. We recommend that if you're able to get
	one of the riddler's trophies you immediately bring them to the police, but if you want to keep one of them as a 
	memnto we won't tell.</p>

	billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. Wayne tower stands as a symbol of hope and innovation for Gotham's residents. The 
	tour will take you through the tower's research, development, and server rooms. You can even visist the tower's 
	observation deck that gives visitors a beautiful 360 degree view of the city. Visiting Gotham's tallest
