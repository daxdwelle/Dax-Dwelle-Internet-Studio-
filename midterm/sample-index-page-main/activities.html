	<h2 style="font-size: 35px;">Find Riddler Trophies</h2>
	<p>Throughout Gotham the villainous Riddler places trophies all over the city for people to find. 
		In order to acquire these trophies typically you'll have to solve a puzzle or riddle. Sometimes 
		they involve just finding the right answer to a question, but other times you may be operating a 
		dangerous generator. These trophies aren't necessarily intended for the average citizen, but there's 
		nothing stopping you from engaging with them. We recommend that if you're able to get one of the 
		riddler's trophies you immediately bring them to the police, but if you want to keep one of them 
		as a memento we won't tell.</p>
