<h1  style="font-size: 75px;">Design Statement</h1>
<p>When it came to making visual choices for this website I wanted to emphasize the 
	aesthetics of Batman and the gothic look of Gotham city. This can be seen in the 
	heading text that I picked, Alegreya SC. Alegreya SC gives off a gothic, but royal 
	feel that I think is in line with the aesthetics of Gotham city. For the paragraph 
	and list font I chose Anek Telugu which I thought was very readable and had a bit 
	more of a high tech design. I thought it was important to emphasize that element of 
	Gotham as well since there are things like Wayne tower and Ace chemicals that represent 
	sci-fi elements of the city. </p>
	<p>With text placement I wanted to put all of the main titles of every site in the very 
		center to make it clear as possible to the user what page they’re using. I often attached 
		the header 2 to an image to build a visual relationship between the text and the images. 
		I wanted to place the “call-to-action” buttons around the text to create a flow of information 
		that would lead to a user taking action. Regarding text size I decided to increase the size of
		the header 1 and header 2 text. It was especially important to me to increase the header 2 text 
		since I felt like the default settings made it look too much like paragraph text. Even though I 
		increased the size of both header fonts I wanted to make sure that the sizes were noticeably different 
		to create a clear hierarchy of information. 
</p>
	<p>
		I made much of the text white to contrast with the dark background and much of the black imagery 
		I included on the site. I wanted to make the background image an image of bats flying, but I decided 
		that it looked too busy so I turned to a less intrusive black pattern. Much of the color I used throughout 
		the site is meant to evoke the image of Batman's costume. Such as the yellow buttons in the black navigation 
		bar evoking Batman’s chest logo. Even the color of the footer is a light grey color that matches certain depictions 
		of Batman's costume. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I wanted the images I chose to highlight the scope of Gotham City. The hero image that I picked for the home page
		depicts a sprawling city scape with a lot of depth. The images that I chose for the “things to do” section depicted 
		different sides of Gotham City. The image of the riddler trophy emphasizes the dark undercurrent of the city, while 
		the image of Wayne tower emphasizes a hopeful optimism. 
	</p>
	<p>
			The buttons were also styled to fit with the aesthetics of the site. I made the background color completely 
		black while making the text white, which is another example of the light and dark contrast I used very frequently.
		I did want to include a little grey in order to make sure that it’s easy for users to find and access it.
